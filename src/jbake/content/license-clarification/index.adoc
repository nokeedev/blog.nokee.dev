// Target audience: users

Thus far, we developed Nokee in the _open_ without ever having a precise Open Source Software (OSS) license.
It can be a legal blocker for some teams when adopting Nokee for native development with Gradle.
Today, we are officially clarifying Nokee source code under *Apache 2.0 license*.
We believe this change will help Nokee grow further alongside Gradle.

== Why Apache 2.0?

The Gradle team already licenses Gradle Build Tool under Apache 2.0.
Our license choice needs to be compatible with the Gradle Build Tool itself.
To maximize Nokee's adoption, settling on Apache 2.0 was a natural choice.
It will also reduce friction with your legal department.

== What about previous versions?

We won't be making any changes to the previous Nokee versions.
However, if your team needs an Apache 2.0 friendly license for those versions, please send your request to support@nokee.dev.
We will work together to find a solution for your needs.

If you have any questions, always feel free to reach out to me via https://nokee.dev/blog/{jbake-permalink}#disqus_thread[comments on the blog post], sending an email to hello@nokee.dev, or https://app.slack.com/client/TA7ULVA9K/CDDGUSJ7R[joining the Gradle Community Slack].
