Starting today, we are will be following the philosophy living at HEAD.

We haven't found any compeling reason to stay behind on older releases.
We will still produce minor and major version tags to mark certain milestone.
The structure of how the build are going to be configured will mostly stay the same in the future but only better.


Maintaining all these versioned documentation has being a bottleneck for our newer release.
With that, we a dumping all of our archived documentation in favor of a truely living and breathing documentation.
