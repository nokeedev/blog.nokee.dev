As more users adopt Nokee for building their native codebases, we often get asked what's the latest version they can try.
As part of an effort to answer this question, we introduce a web service available at link:https://services.nokee.dev[services.nokee.dev].
The service aims at gathering useful information about Nokee.
It also lay the groundwork for tighter integration with Gradle, which we will announce shortly.

At the moment, we expose version information about the link:https://services.nokee.dev/versions/latest-snapshot.json[latest snapshot], link:https://services.nokee.dev/versions/current.json[latest release] and link:https://services.nokee.dev/versions/all.json[all available versions].
We update the data daily.
If you have neat ideas or want to improve this web service, feel free to link:https://github.com/nokeedev/services.nokee.dev[open issues or contribute to the GitHub repository].

Stay tuned for more information about the upcoming Nokee release.
