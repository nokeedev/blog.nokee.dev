Today we are introducing development logs (also known as _devlog_) to help keep our users and sponsors informed and connected.
Those short-form, semi-formal posts focus on where we spent our efforts since the last entry.
Feel free to link:mailto:hello@nokee.dev[reach out to us] if you have a particular request to be included in those updates.

The link:/devlog-1[first devlog] is already available.
