Join me today in celebrating the link:/docs/0.2.0/release-notes.html[second release of the Nokee plugins] with some oatmeal cookies. footnote:[I added semi-sweet chocolat chips to the link:https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19247/soft-oatmeal-cookies/[cookie recipe].]
Some great features are being released like the support for macOS framework as normal dependencies.
I will also go through the outcomes of various experimentation that happen since the first release.

== macOS Framework Dependencies

It is common for macOS and iOS developers to rely on frameworks as dependencies.
Historically, developers had to rely on the compiler and linker flags to support them.
Why does it have to be this way?
This release introduces the first step in enabling macOS framework bundles as standard dependencies.
There are some limitations to the current implementation, and I'm going to work on removing them in future releases.

The following code snippet shows two interesting aspects of framework dependencies.
Head over to the link:/docs/0.2.0/samples/jni-library-with-framework-dependencies[sample page for the complete code].

         }
      }
   }
}

====
<1> Adding dependencies on a system framework
<2> Adding dependencies on a subframework of a system framework

As shown in the previous snippet, a framework dependency is as simple as any other dependencies.
In fact, the framework dependency resolution uses the Gradle dependency engine.
It uses a magic group name (e.g. `dev.nokee.framework`) so the resolution engine can direct the request to the right resolver.
Despite https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Tasks/IncludingFrameworks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002257-97149[Apple's recommendation to avoid referencing subframework directly] footnote:[Subframeworks are frameworks embedded in other frameworks. In a nutshell, they should be seen as implementation details of the target framework and, like everything, there are exceptions], there is still a need to reference them for https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemFrameworks/SystemFrameworks.html[older deprecated frameworks like `JavaVM` and its subframework, `JavaNativeFoundation`].
The dependency on subframework support is modeled using the link:{gradle-user-manual}/dependency_management_terminology.html#sub:terminology_capability[Gradle capability support].
The second example in the above snippet shows a dependency on the `JavaNativeFoundation` subframework.
You can see the complete link:/docs/0.2.0/samples/jni-library-with-framework-dependencies[sample inside the documentation].

An interesting side-effect of using the Gradle dependency engine is the ability to customize your dependency just like any other dependencies.

You may be wondering how do the Nokee plugins hook into the dependency engine?
One of the highest requested feature for native during my time at Gradle was support for Conan packages.
Adam and I even experimented footnote:[Mostly just Adam; I simply made the code merge ready] with https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commits/am/resolver-spike[adding support for Homebrew using a custom resolver] for consuming native artifacts.
The issue with this approach is how tangled it is with the internal of Gradle.
The spike we developed doesn't work with the latest Gradle.
It just shows how fragile such an approach is, and it's not something I can maintain.
There are also other artifact types the Nokee plugins should support out-of-the-box (e.g. Nuget, system libraries, Windows SDK/DDK, and toolchains).
Gradle's dependency engine is powerful.
Relying on the Gradle's dependency engine for the artifact resolution has positive side-effects.
For starter, we can benefit from the link:{gradle-user-manual}/rich_versions.html[rich version matching] or link:{gradle-user-manual}/resolution_rules.html[gracefully resolve dependency conflict].
What about link:{gradle-user-manual}/variant_model.html[variant selection]?
Native artifacts have the same variant selection problems.

The big problem is how we can feed custom dependency data inside the dependency engine?
Nokee's solution is an embedded HTTP server that serves as a customizable resolver for finding and providing all the required artifacts to your build.
It uses all public APIs, which makes the solution forward compatible.
The challenge is to ensure harmony between Gradle and Nokee without impacting the performance of the build.
Thankfully, the Gradle team has been releasing helpful features such as the build service that enable such a solution.
The consumers request artifacts as a standard group, artifact, version (GAV) triplet, optionally using the rich Gradle metadata for more advanced selection.
Nokee's embedded server aggregate all the artifacts found by his resolvers and let Gradle perform the selection and conflict resolution.
It effectively creates a translation layer between Gradle and the chaotic world of native.

== New Objective-C and Objective-{cpp} Language Plugins

A language plugin's sole job is to provide a specific implementation language capability to the applied project.
With this release, I'm introducing two new language plugins to support JNI libraries written in Objective-C and Objective-{cpp}.
They work just like any of the link:/docs/0.2.0/manual/plugin-references.html#sec:native-language-plugins[other Nokee language plugins].

== JNI Library Resource Path Customization

The previous version had incomplete support for multi-variant JNI libraries.
When assembling the JAR of the final JNI library, there was no way to customize the resource path where to put the native libraries would reside.
Some JNI projects already have an opinion on where the native libraries are located inside the JAR so they can be unpacked and loaded at runtime.
This release allows users to link:/docs/0.2.0/samples/jni-library-with-resource-path[customize the resource path per-variant].
A default mapping is provided based on the project group and ambiguous dimension values (e.g. when several supported operating systems).

== Testing Coverage

Before I learned about the upcoming Gradle support for distributed testing, I did some experimentation on spawning Gradle workers on remote machines.
In a previous job, I wrote a remote native testing capability for Gradle.
I can't begin to tell you how useful it was, not for performance, but for the convenience of being able to test the code on specific systems by any developers.
I recently had a great discussion with a community member regarding his bare metal x86 development with Gradle.
At such a low level, the issue is rarely the build time.
Usually, it's all the intermediate steps that are required to accurately tests the software.
Often those steps are so troublesome that testing isn't automated if you are even lucky to have testing in place.

In my case, I wanted to simplify the testing infrastructure by avoiding the classic dance of fanning out the pipeline at the testing phase.
My experiment had some success on Linux but hit some roadblock on Windows.
I decided to shelve the idea for the time being.
However, rest assured that remote orchestration of Gradle workers would be hugely beneficial for the native ecosystem.

== What's Next?

The next versions will focus on adding support for Swift implementation language, the last native language needed before attacking full on iOS support in Gradle.
There will be improvements to toolchain support, in particular the toolchain selection.
At the moment, toolchain selection is preventing FreeBSD official support.
It's also preventing cross-compilation on all major operating system which in turn prevent iOS support in Gradle.

There will also be improvements to the testing coverage, particularly across multiple toolchains and multiple Gradle.
Both of these are being worked on as part of the https://github.com/gradle-plugins/toolbox[Gradle Development Plugins], a project aimed at improving plugin authoring.
The goal is to provide near zero-configuration for Gradle plugin development.
It also extends the core plugin development by modelling minimum Gradle version support and fixtures to improve your testing coverage.
The next versions will focus on adding testing strategies for the plugin functional tests across multiple Gradle version.
